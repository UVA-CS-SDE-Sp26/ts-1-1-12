Tasks:
1. Connect the command line interface from Member A to the file manager Member B
    Member A will provide a number etc. I will have to turn that number into a file name and
    pass it to Member B.


Psuedo Code:

class ProgramControl:

    on initialize:
        Setup a FileHandler to manage file operations

    function displayFilesListed():
        tell FileHandler to scan the folder
        get the list of filenames

        if the list is empty THEN:
            print "No files found"
            exit function

        for each file in the list:
            print (Current Index + 1) and the Filename

    function displayFileContents(user_choice_number):
        try:
            tell FileHandler to scan the folder again (refresh)
            get the list of filenames

            set internal_index = user_choice_number - 1

            if internal_index is invalid (out of list bounds) THEN:
                PRINT "Error: File number out of range"
                EXIT function

            set target_file = filename at internal_index
            set file_text = READ contents of target_file

            print file_text

        catch Read/Write Error:
            print "Error reading file" and the reason

        catch Other Errors:
            print "An unexpected error occurred"

 Test Psudeo:
 class programcontroltest:

     before each test:
         setup a way to capture everything the program prints to the screen.
         this lets the test "read" what the user would normally see.

     after each test:
         stop capturing the output and reset the screen settings to normal.

     test: display_list_format
         1. create a mock (fake) file handler.
         2. tell the mock to act like it found "alpha.txt" and "beta.txt".
         3. run the command to list files.
         4. check the captured text for "01 alpha.txt" and "02 beta.txt".
         5. verify the program actually triggered the folder scan.

     test: display_empty_folder
         1. tell the mock file handler to return an empty list.
         2. run the command to list files.
         3. check that the output says "no files found".

     test: display_content_success
         1. tell the mock that file 1 is "target.txt".
         2. tell the mock to return "secret message" when "target.txt" is read.
         3. run the command to show content for file 1.
         4. check that "secret message" was printed exactly as expected.

     test: display_content_bad_index
         1. tell the mock there is only 1 file available.
         2. try to run the command for file 5.
         3. check that the output contains an "error" message regarding the "range".

     test: display_content_read_failure
         1. tell the mock there is a file called "corrupt.txt".
         2. tell the mock to trigger a "disk failure" error when that file is opened.
         3. try to run the command for file 1.
         4. check that the program caught the error and printed "error reading file: disk failure".
