TopSecret Filehandler 2/3/26
Ryder McCoy-Hansen rpw8ff

The topsecret class is the program entry point
This class takes a index of a file, parses a list of the files in the directory, then return the data in that specific file

Goals:
You are responsible for the part of the problem that reads data files.
The program should expect files in a folder named data (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
When a request for a file is received, this part of the program will return the file contents.
This part of the program should handle all the direct access to files.
Document the plan your team makes for the design of your software in a text file named filehandler.txt.

Psuedo Code:
let dataFolder = "data"
let filenames = empty list of strings

Constructor:
    CREATE File object using dataFolder
    If folder does not exist OR is not a directory
        error "Data folder does not exist"

listfiles()
    CLEAR filenames list

    CREATE File object using dataFolder
    files = list of all items in folder

    If files is not null
        FOR EACH item IN files
            If item is a file
                ADD item name to filenames

readfile(filename)
    filePath = dataFolder + file separator + fileName
    CREATE File object using filePath

    If file does not exist OR is not a file
        error "File not found"

    contents = empty string

    OPEN file for reading
    While there is a next line
        Read line
        Append line and newline to contents
    Close file
    Return contents


Tests:
Constructor----
Verify constructor throws exception if data folder does not exist; expects IllegalStateException.
Verify constructor works correctly when data folder exists; expects no exception.

listFiles----
Check that listFiles() finds and stores all file names in the folder; expects list to contain all files.
Ensure listFiles() does not duplicate entries on multiple calls; expects correct file count after repeated calls.

readfile----
Verify readFile() reads file content correctly; expects returned string to contain expected content.
Ensure error is thrown when reading a non-existent file; expects IOException.
Verify directories cannot be read as files; expects IOException.
