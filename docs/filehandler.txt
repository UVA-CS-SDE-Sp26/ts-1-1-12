TopSecret Filehandler 2/3/26
Ryder McCoy-Hansen rpw8ff

The topsecret class is the program entry point
This class takes a index of a file, parses a list of the files in the directory, then return the data in that specific file

Goals:
You are responsible for the part of the problem that reads data files.
The program should expect files in a folder named data (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
When a request for a file is received, this part of the program will return the file contents.
This part of the program should handle all the direct access to files.
Document the plan your team makes for the design of your software in a text file named filehandler.txt.

Tests:
Ensure the correct file is returned wit the correct data type
